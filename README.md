# devfest.in

This is a weekend project of me(@abhimanyuma) and master(@haricm) to develop a
small crowdsourcable event listings for developer events in India.

First attempted go at the framework is being built on Express with Node, and
React and something I am yet to figure out along with it, and using MySQL that I
plan to move to PostgreSQL.

P.S : Not related to other stuff named "devfest" in any way.
